# 😊 Real-Time Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📝 Project Description
This project focuses on leveraging data science, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze employee emotions and moods using inputs such as text, facial expressions, or speech. The system provides insights into emotional states and recommends tasks that align with individual moods to enhance productivity and well-being.

Additionally, it detects employees experiencing stress, burnout, or negative emotions and alerts HR or higher authorities to take timely action. This fosters a healthier and more empathetic workplace by enabling support mechanisms such as counseling, stress management programs, or workload adjustments.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect and analyze emotions in real time.
- Use various data sources such as text input, facial expressions, and speech patterns.
- Provide actionable insights to improve workplace well-being and productivity.
- Notify HR of employees experiencing stress or burnout for timely intervention.

## 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes open-source datasets from platforms such as Kaggle, containing:
- **Text-based emotion data** (e.g., sentiment-labeled text inputs)
- **Facial expression datasets** (labeled with emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- **Speech emotion datasets** (analyzing tone and pitch variations)

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean emotion datasets.
   - Convert textual data into embeddings (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec, FastText).
   - Extract features from images (CNN-based models like ResNet, VGG16).
   - Analyze speech signals using spectrograms and MFCC features.

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize emotion distribution in datasets.
   - Identify key trends and patterns in mood variations.

3️⃣ **Model Building & Training**
   - Train ML models (Random Forest, SVM) for text-based emotion detection.
   - Use CNN models for facial expression recognition.
   - Implement RNN or Transformer-based models for speech emotion analysis.

4️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Apply hyperparameter tuning for better results.

5️⃣ **Real-Time Emotion Detection System**
   - Integrate models into a real-time system.
   - Use Flask for API development to interact with a web-based UI.
   - Enable live webcam emotion detection for facial analysis.
